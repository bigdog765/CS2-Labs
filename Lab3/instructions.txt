For this lab you will be modifying the existing LinkedList.cpp file to now work as a doubly linked list. 
The ListLinked.h file is updated with new *prev and *tail pointers, an update to the constructor's definition that you must include in your ListLinked.cpp, 
and two new functions: moveForwardN and moveBackwardN.

You must make updates to:
-Constructor
-Insert
-Remove (update the 3 if/else statements to update ->prev pointer)
-goToPrior (to now include implementation with cursor->prev)


Lastly, you must write the moveForwardN and moveBackwardN functions at the end of the ListLinked.cpp file. 
These two functions either move you forward or backward n nodes in your linked list. 
If your loop goes out of bounds and the next or prev pointers ==0, then break out of the function.
This will set your cursor to either the front or the end of the list depending on the chosen direction.
